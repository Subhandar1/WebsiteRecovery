# WebsiteRecovery

WebsiteRecovery is a simple bash script which attempts to create a clone of the latest snapshot of a website on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.

It can be used, for example, to recover a website which was lost by some service provider or which was vandalized by some random hacker.

It was born in one night, when the known Warrick tool was failing to recover a website I needed.
The script is far from being perfect, and there are a lot of konwn issues.

The code could be optimized a lot, both in terms of requests to the Wayback Machine, and in terms of checks done. Anyhow, it made my day in downloading the website that I was needing.
